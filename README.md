# Host-Candida-metabolic-modelling

The repository contains the codes to reproduce the figures and flux profiling results of context-specific *Candida albicans* models and integrated human-Candida metabolic model. The inputs included the transcriptomics data used in the analysis along with the mapping files to convert the CGD annotations to BiGG annotations to ensure the compatability of the model. The codes included both context-specific model reconstruction and analysis and host-microbe integrated model and knockout analysis.
